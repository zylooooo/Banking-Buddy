# Development Mode Setup âœ…

## The White Screen Issue is Fixed! 

### What was the problem?
The `App.jsx` file was empty, which caused React to render nothing (white screen).

### What I fixed:
1. âœ… **Recreated App.jsx** with complete routing structure
2. âœ… **Added development authentication** (no AWS Cognito needed for now)
3. âœ… **Created mock login system** with Admin and Agent roles

## ðŸš€ How to Use the CRM System Now

### 1. Open your browser to: http://localhost:3000

### 2. You'll see the Scrooge Global Bank login page with:
- ðŸ”‘ **"Login as Admin"** (red button) - Full system access
- ðŸ‘¤ **"Login as Agent"** (blue button) - Client management access

### 3. Click either button to explore different roles:

#### As Admin (`/admin`):
- âœ… System dashboard with statistics
- âœ… User Management - Create/manage system users
- âœ… Full client and account access
- âœ… Complete transaction monitoring

#### As Agent (`/agent`):
- âœ… Personal dashboard with your metrics

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps for Production

When ready for production, you'll need to:

1. **Switch back to AWS Cognito:**
   ```bash
   mv src/services/authService.js src/services/authService.dev.js
   mv src/services/authService.cognito.js src/services/authService.js
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Fill in your AWS Cognito details
   ```

3. **Build your backend API** to replace the mock data

- âœ… Navigate through all pages
